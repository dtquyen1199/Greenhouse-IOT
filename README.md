Greenhouse-IOT-Project

IoT-based smart greenhouse system that consists of three IoT nodes, each connected to an 
Arduino Uno microcontroller which monitor and sense changes in the temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light level.

A virtual Raspberry Pi is used as a cloud server and uses MQTT protocol to receive and store data
into the database to make data driven decisions via edge server analytics to adapt environmental conditions for optimal plant growth
